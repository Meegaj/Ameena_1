The script begins by importing the necessary library, numpy, which is fundamental for handling numerical operations involving matrices.

# Cofactor Function

Cofactor is specifically tailored for 5x5 matrices. It takes three inputs: a 5x5 matrix and the row and column indices of the element whose cofactor is to be calculated.

The function first verifies the dimensions of the input matrix. If the matrix is not 5x5, it raises a ValueError, ensuring the function operates correctly with the intended input size.

It then creates a sub-matrix by eliminating the specified row and column from the original matrix. This step is crucial as the cofactor is calculated on the smaller matrix that remains after removing the specified row and column.

The determinant of the resulting 4x4 sub-matrix is computed and the cofactor is calculated by applying the formula (-1)^(row + column) * determinant, considering the sign change that occurs in a matrix's cofactor expansion.

# Sample Execution:

The script generates a sample 5x5 matrix for demonstration purposes and prints an element from this matrix, specifically the element at the 3rd row and 2nd column (denoted as A3,2), to show the value for which the cofactor will be calculated.

It then executes the cofactor function for the specified element (A3,2) in the sample matrix, prints the determinant of the sub-matrix, and returns the calculated cofactor.
